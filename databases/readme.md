[adapters.fa](/databases/adapters.fa) and [phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz](/databases/phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz) are copies of the  of the reference files supplied with bbtools/bbmap v37.62 (in the bbmap 'resources' folder). [adapters.fa](/databases/adapters.fa) is a database of various sequencing adapters that might be present in the data. [phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz](/databases/phix174_ill.ref.fa.gz) is a reference genome for PhiX. v37.62 is the version of bbtools currently specified by [envs/bbtools.yaml](/envs/bbtools.yaml).

The copies of these files that come bundled with bbtools do not seem to get picked up properly when bbduk is installed by conda, so we are supplying them here instead and providing a path at the command line.

Later versions of bbtools are available (up to v38.96) but not through conda. The adapters.fa files available with these later versions include some extra sequences (e.g. four extra Illumina RNA adapters) but are identical with respect to the TruSeq adapters that are mainly relevant to us. So we are using the file from v37.62 so that bbduk behaves in the same way as it would if it had been installed without conda and was able to find the bundled file.
