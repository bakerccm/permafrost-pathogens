2.1 Permafrost Core Collection and Processing
The study site is in the discontinuous permafrost zone and aboveground vegetation is dominated by Picea mariana forest with Sphagnum moss, Rhododendron groenlandicum, and Betula nana (Figure 1).  In July of 2017, permafrost samples were collected from the PT in Fox, Alaska (64.9528°N, -147.6178°W), which represents syngenetic, ice rich, high carbon content “yedoma type” permafrost with large ice wedges surrounded by ice cemented aeolian silt [24]. The PT includes the north tunnel, excavated in the mid-1960s, and the south tunnel, excavated in 2013. The PT’s temperature varies between -2 and -4°C, and has never thawed since excavation [25]. We used a gas-powered SIPRE (Snow, Ice, and Permafrost Research Establishment) corer (Jon’s Machine Shop, Fairbanks, Alaska, USA) to collect triplicate permafrost cores by drilling ~1 meter horizontally into the walls of the PT in areas of ice cemented silt.  Triplicate cores were collected 35 m, 45 m, 60 m, and 83 m from the portal of the north tunnel and 23 m from the portal of the new section of the south tunnel and were designated as P1, P2, P3, P4, P5 respectively (Figure 1).
